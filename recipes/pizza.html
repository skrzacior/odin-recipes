        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 cup cold water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>½ cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>6 leaves fresh basil, torn</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a large bowl. Let stand for 5
                minutes to proof. Stir in salt and cold water, then stir in the
                flour about 1 cup at a time. When the dough is together enough
                to remove from the bowl, knead on a floured surface until
                smooth, about 10 minutes. Divide into two pieces, and form each
                one into a tight ball. Coat the dough balls with olive oil, and
                refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. Be sure
                to use a big enough container to allow the dough to rise. Remove
                the dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550
                degrees F. Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using one ball of dough at a time, lightly dust the dough with
                flour, and stretch gradually until it is about 14 inches in
                diameter, or about as big around as the pizza stone. Place on
                the floured peel. Place thin slices of mozzarella over the
                crust, then grind a liberal amount of black pepper over it.
                Sprinkle with dried oregano. Randomly arrange crushed tomatoes,
                leaving some empty areas. Drizzle olive oil over the top.
            </li>
            <li>
                With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure the dough will
                release from the peel easily. Place the tip of the peel at the
                back of the preheated pizza stone, and remove peel so that the
                pizza is left on the stone.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 4 to 6 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the
                crust begins to brown. Remove from the oven by sliding the peel
                beneath the pizza. Sprinkle a few basil leaves randomly over the
                pizza. Cut into wedges and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
